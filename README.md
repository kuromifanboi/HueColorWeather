# HueColorWeather
Visualize the weather with Phillips hue lighting

# About this project
This is an open-source project that will allow you to ask google the weather with a twist! When Google reads the weather, this will affect smart lighting (Phillips Hue for now) by changing the color, and optionally the lighting depending on the local time. This is designed under the concept of being accessible for Home Assistant as a plugin and open source to allow others to merge their ideas and creations into this project

# Features (WIP)
• Local web app for offline use
• Simple setup via Hue
• Allow the addition of alarms and timers [TBD]
• Homeassistant plugin Integration [TBD]
